Got to be a joker he just do what he please. rocky raccoon...<br>
now rocky raccoon he was a fool unto himself,<br>
and he would not swallow his foolish pride.<br>

Mother Mary comes to me<br>
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be<br>
And in my hour of darkness<br>
She is standing right in front of me<br>
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be. Blackbird singing in the dead of night<br>
Take these broken wings and learn to fly<br>
All your life<br>
You were only waiting for this moment to arise. What would you think if I sang out of tune<br>
Would you stand up and walk out on me?<br>
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song<br>
And I'll try not to sing out of key. I'll buy you a diamond ring, my friend<br>
If it makes you feel all right<br>
I'll get you anything my friend<br>
If it makes you feel all right<br>
'Cause I don't care too much for money. You say yes, I say no<br>
You say stop and I say go go go, oh no<br>
You say goodbye and I say hello<br>
Hello hello<br>
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello<br>
Hello hello<br>
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello. When I get older<br>
Losing my hair<br>
Many years from now<br>
Will you still be sending me a Valentine?<br>
Birthday greetings bottle of wine? It was twenty years ago today<br>
Sgt. Pepper taught the band to play<br>
They've been going in and out of style<br>
But they're guaranteed to raise a smile<br>
So may I introduce to you<br>
The act you've known for all these years<br>
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. When I was younger, so much younger than today<br>
I never needed anybody's help in any way<br>
But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured<br>
Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors. Two of us riding nowhere<br>
Spending someone's hard-earned pay<br>
You and me Sunday driving<br>
Not arriving<br>
On our way back home<br>
We're on our way home<br>
We're on our way home<br>
We're going home. Once there was a way, to get back homeward,<br>
Once there was a way, to get back home<br>
Sleep pretty darling do not cry, <br>
and I will sing a lullaby<br>
Boy you're gonna carry that weight, <br>
carry that weight for a long time<br>
Boy you're gonna carry that weight, <br>
carry that weight for a long time. You think you lost your love,<br>
When I saw her yesterday.<br>
It's you she's thinking of<br>
And she told me what to say.<br>
She says she loves you<br>
And you know that can't be bad.<br>
Yes, she loves you<br>
And you know you should be glad. ooh! It's been a hard day's night, and I've been working like a dog<br>
It's been a hard day's night, I should be sleeping like a log<br>
But when I get home to you I find the things that you do<br>
Will make me feel alright. I once had a girl<br>
Or should I say she once had me<br>
She showed me her room<br>
Isn't it good Norwegian wood? I want her everywhere<br>
And if she's beside me I know I need never care<br>
But to love her is to need her everywhere<br>
Knowing that love is to share<br>
Each one believing that love never dies<br>
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there<br>
I will be there and everywhere<br>
Here, there and everywhere. There's a chance that we may fall apart before too long<br>
We can work it out<br>
We can work it out<br>
Life is very short<br>
And there's no time<br>
For fussing and fighting, my friend<br>
I have always thought<br>
That it's a crime<br>
So I will ask<br>
You once<br>
Again<br>
Try to see it my way<br>
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong<br>
While you see it your way<br>
There's a chance that we may fall apart before too long<br>
We can work it out<br>
We can work it out. Hey!<br>
